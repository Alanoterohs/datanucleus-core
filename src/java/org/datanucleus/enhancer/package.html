        DataNucleus ByteCode enhancer framework.
        The <B>DataNucleusEnhancer</B> class is the typical entry point for command line usage.
        DataNucleus supports persistence where the persistable classes are bytecode enhanced
        to a particular contract to facilitate easier access to field values, and when fields are changed.
        One such bytecode enhancement contract is the standardised JDO enhancement contract, which
        is supported with the classes under "org.datanucleus.enhancer.jdo".
