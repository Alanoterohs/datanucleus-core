<BODY>
    Provides classes relating to the life cycle state management of a persistable object. 
    Refer to section 5.5 of the JDO 1.0 specification for a description of this type of StateManager.
    
    The <I>org.datanucleus.enhancement.StateManager</I> definition of a StateManager is extended by <B>org.datanucleus.state.DNStateManager</B> 
    providing the additional handling needed for participating in the persistence process.
    
    Each persistable object has a particular <I>org.datanucleus.state.LifeCycleState</I> and the associated states for each API allow transitioning between states
    using the associated methods.
