    Package defining the connection to the datastore.

    <h3>ConnectionManager</h3>
    This is the entry point into the connection management process. You use it to get a connection to the datastore (<i>ManagedConnection</i>).
    This manages a "primary" ConnectionFactory and an optional "secondary" ConnectionFactory. Some datastores only support a single factory.

    <h3>ConnectionFactory</h3>
    This is responsible for generating the actual connections to the datastore.
    Each datastore plugin has to implement this for their own datastore.
    There is a provided <i>AbstractConnectionFactory</i> that must be extended to provide this implementation.

    <h3>ManagedConnection</h3>
    This represents the actual connection to the datastore, wrapping the real connection.
    Each datastore plugin has to implement this for their own datastore.
    There is a provided <i>AbstractManagedConnection</i> that must be extended to provide this implementation.
