    Package providing management for federation of datastores.
    This allows us to have a PMF/EMF for multiple datastores, and to distribute any insert/update/delete/fetch to the relevant datastore. 
    It also allows us to query across multiple datastores and federate the results.
    <p>
    The more standard alternative to this is to have a PMF per datastore, and then to persist to whichever you want, and query whichever you want.
    Merging results is then left to the user.
