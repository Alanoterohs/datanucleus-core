    Package providing the evaluation of queries using an in-memory process.
    <p>
        Contains a series of classes implementing <i>org.datanucleus.query.inmemory.InvocationEvaluator</i> providing support for particular functions (in JDOQL/JPQL).
        Contains a series of classes implementing <i>org.datanucleus.query.inmemory.AggregateExpression</i> providing support for aggregation of different java types.
        Note that the in-memory query evaluator only supports a subset of the full syntax supported by JDOQL/JPQL. For example JOINs are not supported, or some subqueries.
