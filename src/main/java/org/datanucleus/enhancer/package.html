        DataNucleus ByteCode enhancer framework.
        The <B>DataNucleusEnhancer</B> class is the typical entry point for command line usage.
        DataNucleus supports persistence where the persistable classes are bytecode enhanced
        to a particular contract to facilitate easier access to field values, and when fields are changed.
        The bytecode enhancement contract that is used here is based on the JDO bytecode enhancement contract,
        and uses ASM to perform the enhancement.
