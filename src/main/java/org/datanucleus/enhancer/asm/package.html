    ASM v7.0 : a small and fast bytecode manipulation framework.
    This is repackaged from "org.ow2.asm" in ASM v7.0.
    The only changes in the code were to fix compiler warnings.

    <p>
    The process to upgrade this "repackaged" ASM is as follows :-
    <ol>
        <li>Open <i>datanucleus-core</i> in Eclipse (or equivalent IDE)</li>
        <li>Download and open the source code for the version of ASM that you want in Eclipse</li>
        <li>Copy all files from <b>org.objectweb.asm</b> (but not sub-packages), and paste these into <b>org.datanucleus.enhancer.asm</b></li>
        <li>Inspect all warnings in Eclipse and fix the formatting of the ASM methods to avoid ALL warnings.</li>
        <li>Update <i>package.html</i> of <b>org.datanucleus.enhancer.asm</b> to mention the current version of ASM that is repackaged</li>
    </ol>
